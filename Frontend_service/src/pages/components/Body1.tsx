              Smart farms utilize technology like IoT, drones, AI, and data
              analytics to optimize agricultural processes. By monitoring crop
              health, soil conditions, and weather in real-time, they improve
              resource management and increase efficiency, leading to higher
              yields. These farms aim to enhance sustainability, reduce resource
              consumption, and boost productivity in agriculture.

            Irrigation is the artificial provision of water to crops, vital in
            areas with insufficient rainfall. It supports plant growth and
            maximizes yields. Different methods like surface, sprinkler, and
            drip irrigation are used based on factors like soil type and water
            availability, aiming for efficient water use and optimal crop
            health.

          <p className="m-4">
            Irrigation helps the plant to grow well with the supply of all the
            nutrients . In addition irrigation provide the plant with water
            which enhance the nutrients flow.

          Although many Rwandans are involved in the agriculture activities, few
          of them are aware of practicing irrigation. So, as the innovators we
          developed the platform for which you can obtain the information about
          irrigation. In case you need the establishment of one of the
